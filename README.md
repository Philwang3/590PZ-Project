# IS590PZ-Project, iSchool at UIUC
GIPF game project

Instructor: John Weible

Team Member: Zhe Wang, Yao Xiao

Dependencies: Pygame and Numpy

Run board.py to go for a two-player match

Run game.py to go for a easy player-AI match

!!!IMPORTANT!!! If you run for a while and the console stops to work, click on the pygame window that running in the
background, and the whole program should be working again. We googled for a huge time for this online but we cannot sort this issue out. Some people say it's because the wait-time limit of PyGame, but we really cannot change it...

Reference

For the visualization part, we looked into piotrf17's gui.py part for reference, specifically, the class structure and some syntax of drawing pieces and board. Then we learnt about that and modified their usage idea to fit our own code.
